## Upgrade `B3TRGovernor` to Version `7` and `XAllocationVoting` to Version `7`

Introduces grant proposal support with dedicated governance parameters, deposit-based voting power, and capped deposit thresholds.

Proposed changes for the following proposal:
["Change the rules to create and support governance proposals"](https://governance.vebetterdao.org/proposals/16456558618029822768724567372248444488437431846368752919370485354508180864756)

### Changes 🚀

- **Upgraded Contract(s):**
  - `B3TRGovernor.sol` to version `7`
  - `XAllocationVoting.sol` to version `7`

### Storage Changes 📦

- **`B3TRGovernor`**:

  **➕ Added (V7)**
  - `proposalType` → Stores the proposal type for each proposal.
  - `proposalTypeDepositThresholdPercentage` → Deposit threshold % per proposal type.
  - `proposalTypeVotingThreshold` → Voting threshold per proposal type.
  - `proposalTypeQuorum` → Quorum history checkpoints per proposal type.
  - `proposalTypeDepositThresholdCap` → Maximum deposit threshold per proposal type.
  - `requiredGMLevelByProposalType` → GM level requirement per proposal type.
  - `depositsVotingPower` → Checkpoints to track deposit-based voting power per user.

  **➖ Deprecated**
  - `depositThresholdPercentage` → Replaced by `proposalTypeDepositThresholdPercentage`.
  - `votingThreshold` → Replaced by `proposalTypeVotingThreshold`.
  - `deposits` → Updated to include proposal ID as first key (`proposalId => user => amount`) for deposit tracking per proposal.

  **📌 Reason for Deprecation**
  - Previous mappings were **global** and did not support proposal-type-specific governance.
  - V7 introduces **type-based governance** (Standard vs Grant), requiring **separate thresholds, quorums, and deposit tracking**.

### New Features 🚀

- **`B3TRGovernor`**:
  - Added `ProposalType.Grant` with dedicated governance parameters.
  - Added deposit-based voting power with checkpoint tracking (`depositsVotingPower`).
  - Implemented deposit threshold caps for standard and grant proposals.
  - Added proposal creation with type specification (`proposeGrant()`).
  - Added GM-level requirements per proposal type (`requiredGMLevelByProposalType`).
  - Integrated `GrantsManager` contract for grant proposals.

- **`XAllocationVoting`**:
  - Updated `_getVotingPower()` to include deposit-based voting power.
  - Added `getDepositVotingPower()` to query deposit-based voting power per user.

### Bug Fixes 🐛

- None.

## Upgrade `X2EarnApps` to Version 5

### Key Updates 🗂

Restriction on creators who have already submitted an app. Any creator added to an xApp (via the `_addCreator` function) will be considered as someone who has already submitted an app, preventing them from creating multiple applications.

### Changes 🚀

- `x2EarnApps` updated to version `5`

### Storage Changes 📦

- None.

### New Features 🚀

- **`X2EarnApps`**:
  - Added `isCreatorOfAnyApp` check based on `_creatorApps[creator]` counter.
  - Added `CreatorNFTAlreadyUsed` error, trigger when a creator try to submit an app while having already submitted an app

  - Renamed `resetUserSignalsByAppAdminWithReason` to `resetUserSignalsByAppWithReason` to be used by `SIGNALER_ROLE`
  - Added `initializeV4()` function to initialize the new role

### Bug Fixes 🐛

- **`VeBetterPassport`**:
  - Fixed arithmetic underflow when resetting signals, which could occur when app admin resets signal count after default admin in sequence

## Upgrade `X2EarnRewardsPool` to Version 6

This upgrade introduces the ability for XApps to include metadata in the reward distribution process, enabling richer and more context-specific information to be stored and emitted during events. A new function, `distributeRewardWithProofAndMetadata`, has been added for this purpose.

### Key Updates

- **Backward Compatibility Preserved**: The original `distributeRewardWithProof` function remains unchanged and continues to work as before for apps that do not wish to use metadata.
- **New Metadata Functionality**: The `distributeRewardWithProofAndMetadata` function accepts a string intended to be a JSON representation. A dedicated event, `RewardMetadata`, is emitted to store this information, following the established internal standards of `_emitProof`.

### Changes 🚀

- **Upgraded Contracts:**
  - `X2EarnRewardsPool.sol` updated to version `6`.

### Storage Changes 📦

- None.

### New Features 🚀

- **`X2EarnRewardsPool`:**
  - Added `distributeRewardWithProofAndMetadata()`, which accepts a string intended to be a JSON representation and emits a new event, `RewardMetadata`, containing this information.
