  "description": "In collaboration with farming communities in India and Ghana, Carboneers stores carbon dioxide while regenerating degraded soils. The soil fertility is good for the farmers and the carbon storage can be used by you, to pause your carbon footprint! Carboneers helps you understand your carbon footprint and introduces a new concept; Carbon Years. By buying 1 Carbon Year, one ton of carbon dioxide is stored for 1 year. And for every Carbon Year, you will receive B3TR tokens, the more Carbon Years, the B3TR. And on top of that, for every B3TR you receive, our farmers will also receive B3TR!",
